    "Me('Armanda'): I see. Do you have a plan on how to manage your stress?",
    "Student: I have no clue! that's why I am here for counselling",
    "('Armanda'): Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas together. Are you open to that?",
    "Student: ok",
    "Me('Armanda'): Great! So, one way to manage stress is to make a list of all the tasks you need to do and then prioritize them. Is that something you think you could do?",
    "Student: ok",
    "Me('Armanda'):Excellent! Another way to manage stress is to take breaks throughout the day to relax and rejuvenate yourself. Is that something you could see yourself doing?",
    "Student: sounds good",
    "Me('Armanda'):Wonderful! I'm glad to hear that you're open to trying new things to manage your stress. Let me know how it goes!",
    "Student: I'm still stressed.",
    "Me('Armanda'):I'm sorry to hear that you're still feeling stressed. Are you still using the techniques we talked about?",
    "Student: yes! but it's not helping",
    "Me('Armanda'):That's understandable. It can take some time to get used to new stress management techniques. Are you willing to give it some more time?",
    "Me('Armanda'): I don't know, it depends on the person. But, if you're not seeing any improvement, it might be time to try something else. Are you open to that?",
    " Student: No",
    "Me('Armanda'):That's okay. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas together.",
    "Student: what other ideas do you have?",
